### What is the API REST?
  REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services. REST is popular due to its simplicity and the fact that it builds upon existing systems and features of the internet's HTTP in order to achieve its objectives, as opposed to creating new standards, frameworks and technologies.


A primary benefit of using REST, both from a client and server's perspective, is REST-based interactions happen using constructs that are familiar to anyone who is accustomed to using the internet's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

An example of this arrangement is REST-based interactions all communicate their status using standard HTTP status codes. So, a 404 means a requested resource wasn't found; a 401 code means the request wasn't authorized; a 200 code means everything is OK; and a 500 means there was an unrecoverable application error on the server.
